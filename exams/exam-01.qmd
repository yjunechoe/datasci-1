Suppose we measure the reaction times (in milliseconds) of both native and non-native speakers as they process words of varying frequency (measured as occurrences per million words). 

```{r}
#| echo: false

rt_by_speaker <- read_csv('https://kathrynschuler.com/datasci/assests/csv/reaction-time-by-speaker.csv')
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(languageR)
```

Then, you use the following code to generate the plots below. 

```r
# Code 1
ggplot(durationsGe, aes(x = DurationOfPrefix, fill = Sex)) +
    geom_density(fill = "lightgray") +
    theme_classic(base_size = 12) +
    labs(y = "") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("white", "gray", "black"))

# Code 2
ggplot(durationsGe, aes(x = DurationOfPrefix)) +
    geom_density(fill = "lightgray") +
    theme_classic(base_size = 12) +
    labs(y = "")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| layout-valign: bottom
#| cap-location: bottom

ggplot(durationsGe, aes(x = DurationOfPrefix, fill = Sex)) +
    geom_density(fill = "lightgray") +
    theme_classic(base_size = 15) +
    labs(tag = "A", y = "")

\clearpage

(d) **(3 points)** The code below makes use of a new geom, `geom_rug()`, to generate plot C, in which each individual data point is plotted along the x-axis like a "rug". 

    ```r
    ggplot(durationsGe, aes(x = DurationOfPrefix)) +
        geom_rug() + 
        geom_histogram() +
        theme_classic(base_size = 12) 

    ```
        
    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| warning: false
    #| layout-ncol: 2
    #| layout-valign: bottom
    #| cap-location: bottom
    ggplot(durationsGe, aes(x = DurationOfPrefix)) +
        geom_rug() + 
        geom_histogram() +
        theme_classic(base_size = 12) +
        labs(tag = "C")
    ```

    In the box below, rewrite the code such the color of the rug is mapped to the `Sex` variable and the bars of the histogram are filled in with the color "lightblue".

### 7. (10 points) Sampling distribution {.unnumbered}

The following data was simulated from Johnson & Newport (1989), a study investigating the English language proficiency of 46 native Korean or Chinese speakers who arrived in the US between the ages of 3 and 39. The researchers were interested in whether the participants' age of arrival to the United States played a role in their English language proficiency. 


```{r}

    score = rnorm(23, 268.8 , 2.9), 
    age = 0, 
    ageGroup = "0"
)

three <- tibble( score = rnorm(7, 269.3, 2.8), 
    age = runif(7, 3, 7), ageGroup = "3-7")
eight <- tibble( score = rnorm(8, 256.0, 6.0), 
    age = runif(8, 8, 10), ageGroup = "8-10")
eleven <- tibble( score = rnorm(8, 235.9, 13.6), 
    age = runif(8, 11, 15), ageGroup = "11-15")
seventeen <- tibble( score = rnorm(23, 210.3, 22.8), 
    age = runif(23, 17, 39), ageGroup = "17-39")

johnson_newport_1989 <- bind_rows(

Suppose we returned a tibble with the number of data points (`n`), the `median`, and the IQR (`lower` and `upper`) grouped by `ageGroup`. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

# A. compute descriptive statistics by group 
johnson_newport_1989 %>% group_by(ageGroup) %>%
    summarise(n = n(), median = median(score), 
        lower = quantile(score, 0.25), upper = quantile(score, 0.75))
```
 
Then, suppose we used `infer` to generate the sampling distribution for the median proficiancy of the **17-39 year old age group**, visualize the distribution, and shade the confidence interval. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| layout-ncol: 2

# B. generate the sampling distribution 17-39 group
samp_distribution <- johnson_newport_1989 %>%

    calculate(stat = "median") 


# hide ci so we can ask about getting the ci a few ways
ci <- samp_distribution %>%
    get_confidence_interval(level = 0.68, type = "percentile")

ci2 <- samp_distribution %>%
    get_confidence_interval(type = "se", point_estimate = 271)

# D. visualize sampling distribution and confidence interval 
samp_distribution %>%

(a) **(2 points)** Which of the following best describes the statistics in the tibble?

    - [ ] Both median and IQR are parametric
    - [ ] Both median and IQR are nonparametric 
    - [ ] Meidan is parametric, but IQR is nonparametric 
    - [ ] Median is nonparametric, but IQR is parametric

(b) **(2 points)** The sampling distribution of the median looks approximately Gaussian. The probability densitiy function for the Gaussian distribution is given by which of the following equations? 


    - [ ] $\frac{\sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$
    - [ ] $\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}\right)$
    - [ ] $\frac{1}{max-min}$
    - [ ] $\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1}}$

(c)  **(3 points)** Fill in the blanks in the sentence below to describe what happens *on each repeat* in which we construct the sampling distribution via bootstrapping.

### 8. (11 points) Hypothesis testing {.unnumbered}

Suppose we want to know whether the participants who arrived as adults (17-39 age group) acheived native performance. We decide to address this question via the 3-step hypothesis testing framework in which we investigate the difference in **medians** between the native English speakers (0 age group) and the adults (17-39 age group). 

We begin by visualizing the data. 


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| layout-ncol: 2

# A. visualize difference with a boxplot
johnson_newport_1989 %>%
    filter(ageGroup %in% c("0", "17-39")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = score, x = ageGroup)) +
    geom_boxplot()

```

Then, we use `infer` to generate the sampling distribution for the difference in **median proficiency** between the native English speakers (0 age group) and the adults (17-39 age group). 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| layout-ncol: 2

# B. compute observed difference in means
diff_medians <- johnson_newport_1989 %>%
    filter(ageGroup %in% c("0", "17-39")) %>%
    specify(response = score, explanatory = ageGroup) %>%
    calculate(stat = "diff in medians", order = c("0", "17-39"))

# C. construct the null distribution with infer
null_distribution <- johnson_newport_1989 %>%
    filter(ageGroup %in% c("0", "17-39")) %>%
    specify(response = score, explanatory = ageGroup) %>%
    hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
    generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
    calculate(stat = "diff in medians", order = c("0", "17-39")) 

# D. visualize the null and shade p-value
null_distribution %>%
    visualize()  +
    shade_p_value(obs_stat = diff_medians, direction = "both")
```


(a) **(2 points)** Which geom is best for our initial visualization of the data? Choose one. 

    - [ ] `geom_histogram()`
    - [ ] `geom_violin()`
    - [ ] `geom_boxplot()`
    - [ ] `geom_density()`
    - [ ] `geom_bar(stat = "identity")`


(b) **(2 points)** Step 1 of the 3-step hypothesis testing framework is to pose the null hypothesis. True or false, the null hypothesis here is that the observed difference in medians is due age group (age of arrival in the US). 

    - [ ] True
    - [ ] False


(c) **(2 points)** Step 2 is to ask, if the null hypothesis is true, how likely is our observed pattern of results? We quantify this likelihood with:

    - [ ] difference in medians
    - [ ] correlation
    - [ ] liklihood estimation
    - [ ] p-value

(c) **(2 points)** Step 3 is to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. In the original paper, Johnson and Newport (1989) concluded that the two groups were significantly different from each other, suggesting that participants who arrived to the US after age 17 did not acheive native proficiency. This implies that they (choose one):

    - [ ] Rejected the null hypothesis
    - [ ] Failed to reject the null hypothesis
    - [ ] Proved the research hypothesis to be true
    - [ ] Proved the null hypothesis to be true
    - [ ] All of the above

(d) **(3 points)** When we calculate the p-value from the simulated null distribution using the `get_p_value()` function, we get **p = 0**. Is this a problem? Why or why not? Explain what a p-value of 0 means in this context.

### 9. (9 points) Correlation {.unnumbered}

Johnson and Newport (1989) also wanted to ask whether years of exposure to English predicted score on the English proficiency task. To address this, they computed the correlation between score and exposure.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2

dat <- rnorm_multi(n = 46, 
                  mu = c(242, 20),
                  sd = c(10, 5),
                  r = c(0.2), 
                  varnames = c("score", "exposure"),
                  empirical = FALSE)

dat %>% ggplot(aes(x = exposure, y = score)) +
geom_point(alpha = .8)
```


(a) **(2 points)** Given the scatterplot of these data, which of the following could be their observed correlation? 

    - [ ] $-0.88$
    - [ ] $0.88$
    - [ ] $0.16$
    - [ ] $0.5$

(b) **(2 points)** True or false, the correlations computed on these data were subject to sampling variability.

    - [ ] True
    - [ ] False

(c) **(3 points)** Johnson and Newport used hypothesis testing to determine whether the correlation they observed was significantly different from zero. We computed a p-value of `0.624` on the correlation we observed in our simulated data. Which figure could represent this p-value visualized on a null distribution generated nonparametrically from 1000 repetitions?

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| warning: false
    #| layout-ncol: 3


    obs_corr <- dat %>%
        specify(response = score, explanatory = exposure) %>%
        calculate(stat = "correlation") 


    null_distribution <- dat %>%
        specify(response = score, explanatory = exposure) %>%
        hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
        generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
        calculate(stat = "correlation") 


    null_distribution %>%
        visualize() +
        shade_p_value(0.23, direction = "two-sided") +
        labs(tag = "A")

    null_distribution %>%
        visualize() +
        shade_p_value(0.624, direction = "two-sided") +
        labs(tag = "B")

    null_distribution %>%
        visualize() +
        shade_p_value(obs_corr, direction = "two-sided") +
        labs(tag = "C")



    ```

    - [ ] A
    - [ ] B 
    - [ ] C 
    - [ ] A or B, there is not sufficient information to differentiate
    - [ ] A or C, there is not sufficient information to differentiate

(d) **(2 points)** What type of relationship does the correlation between years of exposure and score suggest?

    - [ ] Linear
    - [ ] Nonlinear
    - [ ] Independence 
    - [ ] Permute
