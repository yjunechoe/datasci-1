To learn to program in R (or any language), you can read about how to do it, and watch someone else do it; but the only way to really learn is to do it yourself. Create some data structures, try some stuff, and see what happens! Here are some practice quiz questions to guide your learning. We will go over the solutions to these in lab.

## Materials from lab

- [Brittany's lab slides](/assests/pdfs/lab-01-brittany.pdf)
- [Wesley's lab slides](/assests/pdfs/lab-01-wesley.pdf)

<!-- ```{r}
#| echo: false

library(webexercises)
``` -->

## Google Colab

True or false? We can start a new R notebook in Google Colab with `File > New notebook`

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c("True", answer ="True, but we need to change the Runtime environment too", "False")

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

For problem sets, how will you submit your colab notebook for grading? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    answer ="`File > Download > Download .ipynb`, then upload to Gradescope",
    "`File > Download > Download .ipynb`, then upload to Canvas",
    "`File > Download > Download .py`, then upload to Gradescope",
    "`File > Download > Download .py`, then upload to Canvas"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))

```

What version of R is Google Colab running? Hint: use `sessionInfo()`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

```

What is the relationship between R and Google Colab?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "R is a programming language. Google Colab is a smaller, specific version of R.",
    answer="R is a programming language. Google Colab is a development environment where you can run R",
    "R and Google Colab are both programming languages.",
    "R is a paid (proprietary) programming language. Google Colab is a free service to run R."
