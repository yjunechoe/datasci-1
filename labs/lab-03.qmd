# Tidy

## Tidyverse

1. What is the relationship between tidyverse and readr? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        "tidyverse is a package in the readr family of packages", 
        answer ="readr is a package in the tidyverse family of packages",
        "tidyverse and readr are two unrelated packages",
        "tidyverse and reader are two names for the same package"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

1. In the tidyverse, what does "tidy data" refer to? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        "any data we load into the tidyverse",
        "a dataset with no missing values",
        answer="a standard way to organize a dataset",
        "the process of cleaning a dataset"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

1. What is the purpose of the `purrr` package? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        "Data visualization",
        "Data wrangling",
        "Data importing",
        answer="Functional programming",
        "All of the above"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

1. What is the primary purpose of the `readr` package? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        "Data visualization",
        "Data wrangling",
        answer="Data importing",
        "Functional programming",
        "All of the above"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

1. Which of the following returned this message? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis
    library(tidyverse)

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        answer="`library(tidyverse)`",
        "`family(tidyverse)`",
        "`library.collection(tidyverse)`",
        "`library(tidyverse, report=TRUE)`"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```


## purrr 

Suppose we have the following tibble, stored with the variable `df`. 

```{r}
#| echo: false

df <- tibble(
    x = 1:4,
    y = 5:8,
    z = 9:12
)
print(df)
```

1. What will `map(df, mean)` return? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        "the mean of each row",
        answer="the mean of each column",
        "the mean of all values",
        "Error: cannot compute mean of type integer"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```


2. Suppose we wanted to coerce each column in the previous tibble to the data type `double` with one line of code. Fill in the two arguments to `map` that would accomplish this: 

- map(`r fitb("df", width = 10)`, `r fitb("as.double", width = 10)`)



## Tibbles

Suppose we run the following code block and create 3 tibbles: 

```r
# create tibble tib
tib <- tibble(x = 1:2, y = c("a", "b"))

# create tibble x 
x <- tribble(
    ~x, ~y, 
    2, 3, 
    4, 5
)

# create tibble tibby
tibby <- tibble(
        age = c(1, 2, 3, 5),
        name = c("dory", "hazel", "graham", "joan"),
        alt_name = c("dolores", NA, NA, "joanie")
    )
```


1. What will `is.data.frame(tib)` return? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(answer ="True","False")

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        "double", 
        "character",
        "'double' • 'character'",
        answer ="list",
        "tibble",
        "data.frame"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

1. What will `is_tibble(x)` return? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        answer ="True",
        "False"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

1. Which of the following would convert a dataframe called `df` to a tibble? (note that `df` is not defined above, consider any artibrary dataframe) 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        answer ="`as_tibble(df)`", 
        "`as.data.frame(df, tibble)`",
        "`tribble(df)`",
        answer ="`df %>% as_tibble()`",
        answer = "`df |> as_tibble()`"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```


1. What will `tibby$a` return?

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        answer="a warning and the value NULL", 
        "`age` via partial matching",
        "`age` and `alt_name` via partial matching",
        "`hazel`, `graham`, `joan`, and `joanie` via partial matching",
        "an empty vector"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

        mutate(Length/Frequency, .after = Class)

    # option 2
    ratings %>% 
        select(Word:Class) %>%

    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        "summarize all classes including the letter n",

    # code block b
    ratings %>% filter(Class == "animal")
    ```

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c("a", answer="b", "both a and b")

    cat(longmcq(choices))

    ratings %>% arrange(Frequency, order = "descending")

    # code block b
    ratings %>% arrange(Frequency, order = "reverse")

    # code block c

    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```


1. Which of the following code blocks could be used to return the mean frequency by class? 

    ```r
    # code block a
    ratings %>% group_by(Class) %>% summarise( mean = mean(Frequency) )

    # code block b
    ratings %>% summarise( 
        mean = mean(Frequency), .by = c(Class) )

    # code block c
    ratings %>% mean(Frequency) %>% group_by(Class)
    ```

    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    choices <- c("a only", "b only", "c only", answer="a and b", "b and c", "a, b, and c")

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```
