Practice your new stats skills with these practice exam questions! Best to open a fresh Google Colab notebook and test things out! Refer to the study guide to find answers as well.

If you would like to practice with a set of data, you can import the following dataset with `read_csv`: 

```r
# brain volumes simulated from Ritchie et al
"http://kathrynschuler.com/datasets/brain_volume.csv"
```

## Exploring a simple dataset 

(a) Which of the following is the best choice to visualize the frequency distribution of a set of data? Choose one.


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
   "`geom_rug()`", answer="`geom_histogram()`", "`geom_point()`", "`geom_smooth()`"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

(b) Which of the following would summarize the central tendency of a set of data? Choose all that apply.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
   answer="mean", 
   answer="median", 
   "standard deviation",
   "inter quartile range (IQR)"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

(c) Which of the following would summarize the spread of a set of data? Choose all that apply

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
   "mean", 
   "median", 
   answer="standard deviation",
   answer="inter quartile range (IQR)"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

(d) Which of the following are paramteric statistics?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
   answer="mean", 
   "median", 
   answer="standard deviation",
   "inter quartile range (IQR)"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
``` 

(e) Given the following figure, which summary statistics would best describe these data? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
not_normal <- tibble(
    y = c(rep(5, times = 55 ), rep(15, times = 25 ), rep(25, times = 15), rep(32, 5), 42, 55, 62:65, 72:75, 83 
))

sum_stats_not <- not_normal %>%
    summarise(n = n(), mean = mean(y), sd = sd(y))

ggplot(not_normal, aes(x = y)) +
geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "gray", bins = 9, alpha = 0.5) +
coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 60)) +
    labs(x = "y")

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
   "mean", 
   answer="median", 
   "standard deviation",
   answer="inter quartile range (IQR)"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
``` 


(f) Given the following code, which of the following would fill in the blank to return the value below which 20% of the data fall. 

    ```r
    data %>% summarise(
        lower = quantile(y, ________)
    )
    ```

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
    20, 
    -20, 
    "below",
    answer=0.2
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ``` 


## Probability distributions

(a) Write code to generate 200 data points, sampled from a gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

```{r}
#| code-summary: "Answer"
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
rnorm(200, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

(b) Suppose you sampled 500 data points from a uniform distribution and stored the result in `data`. Then, you use the following code to compute the summary stats. What is the height of the probability density function at a value of 5? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
data <- tibble(y = runif(500, max = 10, min = 5.01 ))

```

```{r}

data %>% summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean = mean(y), 
    sd = sd(y), 
    lower = quantile(y, 0), 
    upper = quantile(y, 1)
)

```

`r fitb(0, ignore_case = TRUE)`

(c) Suppose your data is normally distributed and has a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 5. What is the probability a random value drawn from your dataset will be less than 20? Select the closest value.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
0.0483, 
answer=0.1589, 
1.0, 
0

)

cat(longmcq(choices))
``` 






## Sampling variability

(a) True or false, the `parameter` is the mean of the population and the `parameter estimate` is the mean of your sample? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
answer = TRUE,
    FALSE

)

cat(longmcq(choices))
``` 


(b) What do we call the probability distribution of the values our parameter estimate can take on? 

`r fitb("sampling distribution", ignore_case = TRUE)`

(c) Suppose we want to quantify the spread of the sampling distribution. What method could we choose? Choose all that apply. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
"mean", "median", 
answer = "standard error",
answer = "confidence interval"

)

cat(longmcq(choices))
``` 


(d) For a typical experiment, how many samples from the population is practical for us to take? Enter a number.

`r fitb(1, ignore_case = TRUE)`



## Bootstrapping


(a) True or false, when we generate the bootstrap sampling distribution, we sample our original sample *with replacement*.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
answer = TRUE, 
FALSE

)

cat(longmcq(choices))
``` 



(b) Suppose we want to generate the bootstrap sampling distribution for the mean of set of data, `data`, with one variable: `reaction_time`. Write code that uses the `infer` package to accomplish this, generating 1000 samples. 

```{r}
#| code-summary: "Answer"
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
data %>% 
    specify(response = reaction_time) %>%
    generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
    calculate(stat = "mean")
```

(c) Suppose we store our bootstrap sampling distribution from part b in a variable called `bootstrap_distribution`. Which two arguments should we add to the code below to compute the 68% confidence interval and assign it to the value `ci`?

```r
ci <- bootstrap_distribution %>% 
    get_confidence_interval(______, ________)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
'`type="se", level = 68`',
'`type="se", level = 0.68`', 
answer='`type="percentage", level = 0.68`',
'`type="percentage", level = 68`'

)

cat(longmcq(choices))
``` 

(d) Suppose we store our bootstrap sampling distribution in `bootstrap_distribution` and we want to visualize the confidence interval we just computed in c.  Which of the following could we add to the code below? Choose all that apply.

```r
bootstrap_distribution %>%
    visualize() + 
    _____________
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
'`get_confidence_interval(endpoints = ci)`',
answer='`shade_ci(endpoints = ci)`',
answer='`shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = ci)`',
'`get_ci(endpoints = ci)`'

)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```
