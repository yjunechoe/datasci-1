## Primate brains

Primates have brains of varying sizes, and one possible explanation for this variation is differences in body size. Larger-bodied primates may tend to have heavier brains, but this relationship is not always straightforward. To investigate whether body size can reliably explain differences in brain weight across primate species, let's fit a model that predicts brain weight based on body size. 

The data, in case you want to work with it yourself: [primate brains](/assests/csv/primate_brains.csv)

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false

data <- read_csv("https://kathrynschuler.com/datasci/assests/csv/primate_brains.csv")
glimpse(data)
ggplot(data, aes( x = body_weight_g, y = brain_weight_g)) +
    geom_point()
```

### Type of model 

(a) Is this a supervised or unsupervised learning problem? 


    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <-c(
    answer ="Supervised",
    "Unsupervised"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

(b) Is this regression or classification? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <-c(
    answer = "Regression", 
    "Classification"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

(c) Is the relationship between `brain_weight_g` and `body_weight_g` linear or nonlinear? 


    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <-  c(
    "Linear",
    answer ="Nonlinear"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

(d) Is the nonlinear relationship linearizable or non-linearizable? 


    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
   choices <- c(
    answer = "Linearizable nonlinear",
    "Non-linearizable nonlinear",
    "Neither, the relationship is linear"
)

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

(e) What function could we choose to linearize this relationships? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
   choices <- c(
    "Quadratic polynomial",
    "Cubic polynomial",
    answer = "Log transformation",

    "None, the relationship is non-linearizable"
)

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Answer
#| eval: false

# like this (explicit intercept)
log(brain_weight_g) ~ 1 + log_(body_weight_g)

# or like this (implicit intercept)
log(brain_weight_g) ~ log(body_weight_g)

```

### Fitted model

## Social brain hypothesis 

The **Social Brain Hypothesis** argues that the pressures of navigating increasingly complex social environments were a significant driver in the evolution of brain size and intelligence in humans and other primates.

Let's specify and fit this model in R. 


```{r}
model <- lm(log(brain_weight_g) ~ 1 + log(group_size), 
    data = primate_brains)

```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false

primate_brains <- primate_brains %>%
    mutate(y_body_group = predict(model, primate_brains))

ggplot(primate_brains, aes(, 
    y = log(brain_weight_g),
    x = log(group_size))
) +
geom_point(size = 2) +
geom_line(color = "blue", aes(y = y_body_group)) 
```


(a) Fill in the blank: how many inputs does this model have? `r fitb(2)`


::: {.panel-tabset}
## b. Question

Specify the model as an equation 


## Answer

$\log(brain\_weight\_g) = w_1  1 + w_2  \log(group\_size)$

or, if you created new columns in your data with the the log transformed data, for example:

```r
data <- data %>%
    mutate(log_brain_weight = log(brain_weight_g)) %>%
    mutate(log_group_size = log(group_size))
```

then you could have written:

$\log(brain\_weight\_g) = w_1  1 + w_2  \log(group\_size)$

(c) Given the figure above, which of the following could be the free paramter estimate for $w_1$?


    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
    1, 
    0.66, 
    answer = 2.25,
    5,
    "Not enough information to determine this"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

(d) Given the figure above, which of the following could be the free paramter estimate for $w_2$?


    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
    1, 
    answer = 0.66, 
    2.25,
    5,
    "Not enough information to determine this"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

(e) Suppose we encounter a primate in a (log) group size of 4. What could be the model prediction for their (log) brain weight? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
    3.5, 
    4.1, 
    answer = 4.9,
    6.2,
    "Not enough information to determine this"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

::: {.panel-tabset}
## f. Question

Suppose we wanted to include $\log(body\_size\_g)$ back into the model as an additional predictor of  $\log(brain\_size\_g)$. Specify the model in R. 

## Answer


```r
log(brain_size_g) ~ 1 + log(group_size) + log(body_size_g)
```

## Fruit v Leaf eaters 

Diet may influence the relationship between brain and body size in primates because the type of food a species consumes can impact its ability to meet the energy demands of a larger brain. Fruit-eating primates have access to energy-rich, easily digestible food, which could support the metabolic costs of both a large body and a larger, more complex brain.

Let's begin by adding `diet_category` to our plot mapped to the color aesthetic. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

primate_brains %>%
    ggplot(aes(
        y = log(brain_weight_g), 
        x = log(body_weight_g),
        color = diet_category
    )) +
    geom_point(size = 2) 
```

Frugivorous ("Frug") primates primarily eat fruit, while folivorous ("Fol") primates primarily consume leaves. The "Frug/Fol" category refers to primates that combine both fruit and leaf consumption in their diet. "Om" stands for omnivores, which we might suspect is similar to "Frug/Fol" with more variation in diet. To simplify things, let's focus our analysis on just the Fol and Frug categories. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

fruit_v_leaves <- primate_brains %>%
    filter(diet_category %in% c("Fol", "Frug")) 

fruit_v_leaves %>%
    ggplot(aes(
        x = log(body_weight_g), 
        y = log(brain_weight_g), 
        color = diet_category
    )) +
    geom_point() 
```

Suppose we specify a model that predicts brain weight by body size and diet category. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
model <- lm(log(brain_weight_g) ~ log(body_weight_g) + diet_category, data = fruit_v_leaves) 

model
```


::: {.panel-tabset}
## a. Question

Specify the model with a mathematical expression. 


## Answer



$\log(brain\_size\_g) = w_11 + w_2\log(body\_size\_g) + w_3diet\_category$


:::

::: {.panel-tabset}
## b. Question

Notice we did not include an interaction term between body weight and diet category. Why might a modeler make this decision? 

## Answer


A modeler might choose not to include an interaction term based on exploratory visualization. The scatter plot shows roughly parallel lines for frugivorous and folivorous primates, which could indicate that body size influences brain weight similarly, regardless of diet.


:::




(c) True or false: the `diet_category` variable is categorical, so this is a classification problem.

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <-  c("True", answer ="False")

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

::: {.panel-tabset}
## c. Question

Write the *fitted model* as a mathematical expression. 

## Answer

$\log(brain\_size\_g) = -2.8047\times{1} + 0.7778\times{\log(body\_size\_g)} + 0.4576\times{diet\_category}$



:::

(d) Based on the fitted model returned by `lm()` above, which level of `diet_category` is the reference level? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <-  c(answer = "Fol", "Frug", "Not enough information to determine this")

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```





::: {.panel-tabset}
## e. Question

What is the model's prediction for a primate with a (log) body weight of 7 who eats leaves? Write your answer as a mathematical expression without simplifying it. 

## Answer

$\log(brain\_size\_g) = -2.8047\times{1} + 0.7778\times{\mathbf{7}} + 0.4576\times{\mathbf{0}}$
