## Data science workflow

## Loading the tidyverse {.smaller}

Already installed on Google Colab's R kernel:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Returns a message in Google Colab: 

- a list of packages loaded
- a warning of potential name conflicts 
 

## Tidy data

Tidyverse makes use of tidy data, a standard way of structuring datasets: 

1. each variable forms a **column**; each column forms a variable
2. each observation forms a **row**; each row forms an observation
3. value is a **cell**; each cell is a single value

## Tidy data {.smaller}

![Visual of tidy data rules, from R for Data Science](/assests/images/tidy-data.png){fig-align="center" width=80%}

Why tidy data? 

- Because consistency and uniformity are very helpful when programming
- Variables as columns works well for vectorized languages (R!)


# `purr`
Functional programming

to illustrate the joy of `tidyverse` and tidy data

## `purr`

> purrr enhances R’s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. If you’ve never heard of FP before, the best place to start is the family of map() functions which allow you to replace many for loops with code that is both more succinct and easier to read.
> 
> [purrr docs](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)

## The `map_*()` functions

1. Take a vector as input
2. Apply a function to each element
3. Return a new vector 

##  The `map_*()` functions

We say "functions" because there are 5, one for each type of vector: 

- `map()` - list
- `map_lgl()` - logical
- `map_int()` - integer
- `map_dbl()` - double
- `map_chr()` - character

## `map` use case

```{r}

df <- data.frame(
    x = 1:10,
    y = 11:20,
    z = 21:30
)
```

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

with copy+paste
```{r}
mean(df$x)
mean(df$y)
mean(df$z)
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
with `map`
```{r}
map(df, mean)
```

# `tibble`
modern data frames

## `tibble`

> A tibble, or tbl_df, is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less and complain more
> 
> [tibble docs](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)

## `tibble` {.smaller}

Tibbles do less than data frames, in a good way: 

- never changes type of input (never converts strings to factors!)
- never changes the name of variables 
- only recycles vectors of length 1
- never creates row names 


::: aside
The take-away is that `data.frame` and `tibble` sometimes behave differently. The behavior of `tibble` makes more sense for modern data science, so we should us it instead!
:::

## Create a `tibble` {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Coerce an existing object:
```{r}
df <- data.frame(
    x = 1:4,
    y = c("a", "b", "c", "d")
)
as_tibble(df)
```

Pass a column of vectors: 
```{r}
tibble(
    x = 1:4,
    y = c("a", "b", "c", "d")
)
```


:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

Define row-by-row:

```{r}
tribble(
    ~x, ~y,
    "a", 1,
    "b", 2,
    "c", 3,
    "d", 4 
)
```

:::
::::

## Test if `tibble`

With `is_tibble(x)` and `is.data.frame(x)`

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Data frame:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
    x = 1:4,
    y = c("a", "b", "c", "d")
)
```

```{r}
is_tibble(df)
is.data.frame(df)
```


:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

Tibble:

```{r}
tib <- tribble(
    ~x, ~y,
    "a", 1,
    "b", 2,
    "c", 3,
    "d", 4 
)
```

```{r}
is_tibble(tib)
is.data.frame(tib)
```

:::
::::

## `data.frame` v `tibble` {.smaller}

You will encounter 2 main differences:

1. **printing** 
    - by default, tibbles print the first 10 rows and all columns that fit on screen, making it easier to work with large datasets. 
    - also report the type of each column (e.g. `<dbl>`, `<chr>`)
2. **subsetting** - tibbles are more strict than data frames, which fixes two quirks we encountered when subsetting with `[[` and `$`:
    - tibbles *never* do partial matching
    - they *always* generate a warning if the column you are trying to extract does not exist.

# `readr`
reading data 

## `readr`

> The goal of readr is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data from delimited files, such as comma-separated values (CSV) and tab-separated values (TSV). It is designed to parse many types of data found in the wild, while providing an informative problem report when parsing leads to unexpected results.
> 
> [readr docs](https://readr.tidyverse.org/)

## Rectangular data

![Sample csv file from R for Data Science](/assests/images/rectangle-data.png){#fig-rectangledata fig-align="center" width=80%}

## Getting a CSV file from google sheets 

- Let's quickly demo how we'd do this from google sheets

## `read_*()`

The `read_*()` functions have two important arguments: 

1. `file` - the path to the file 
2. `col_types` - a list of how each column should be converted to a specific data type

## 7 supported file types, `read_*()`

- `read_csv()`: comma-separated values (CSV)
- `read_tsv()`: tab-separated values (TSV)
- `read_csv2()`: semicolon-separated values
- `read_delim()`: delimited files (CSV and TSV are important special cases)
- `read_fwf()`: fixed-width files
- `read_table()`: whitespace-separated files
- `read_log()`: web log files

## Read `csv` files 

Path only, `readr` guesses types: 

```r
read_csv(file='"https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv"')

```
. . .

Path and specify col_types:

```r
read_csv(
    file='"https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv"', 
    col_types = list( x = col_string(), y = col_skip() )
)
```

::: aside
Guessing heuristic: character > date-time > double > logical
:::


## `col_types` column specification {.smaller}

There are 11 column types that can be specified: 

- `col_logical()` - reads as boolean TRUE FALSE values
- `col_integer()` - reads as integer
- `col_double()` - reads as double
- `col_number()` - numeric parser that can ignore non-numbers
- `col_character()` - reads as strings
- `col_factor(levels, ordered = FALSE)` - creates factors
- `col_datetime(format = "")` - creates date-times
- `col_date(format = "")` - creates dates
- `col_time(format = "")` - creates times
- `col_skip()` - skips a column 
- `col_guess()` - tries to guess the column

## Reading more complex files {.smaller}

Reading more complex file types requires functions outside the tidyverse:

- **excel** with `readxl` - see [Spreadsheets](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/spreadsheets#excel) in R for Data Science
- **google sheets**  with `googlesheets4` - see [Spreadsheets](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/spreadsheets#google-sheets) in R for Data Science
- **databases** with `DBI` - see [Databases](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/databases) in R for Data Science
- **json data** with `jsonlite` - see [Hierarchical data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/rectangling) in R for Data Science

## Writing to a file

Write to a .csv file with

```r
write_csv(students, "students.csv")
```

arguments: tibble, name to give file

# Common problems `readr`

## Data set containing 3 common problems {.smaller}

```{r}
students <- read_csv('https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv')

students
```

1. Column contains unexpected values (`AGE`)
2. Missing values are not `NA` (`AGE` and `favorite.food`)
3. Column names have spaces (`Student ID` and `Full Name`)

## Column contains unexpected values {.smaller}


Your dataset has a column that you expected to be `logical` or `double`, but there is a typo somewhere, so R has coerced the column into `character`. 

```{r}
students
```

. . . 

Solve by specifying the column type `col_double()` and then using the `problems()` function to see where R failed.

```{r}
students_coerced <- read_csv(
    file = 'https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv', 
    col_types = list(AGE = col_double()))

problems(students_coerced)
```



## Missing values are not `NA` {.smaller}
 
Your dataset has missing values, but they were not coded as `NA` as R expects. 

```{r}
students
```

. . . 

Solve by adding an `na` argument (e.g. `na=c("N/A")`)

```{r}
(students_nas <- read_csv(
    file = 'https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv', 
    na = c("N/A", "<NA>")))
```


## Column names have spaces {.smaller}

Your dataset has column names that include spaces, breaking R's naming rules. In these cases, R adds backticks (e.g. `` `brain size` ``); 

. . . 

We can use the `rename()` function to fix them. 

```{r}
students %>% 
    rename(
        student_id = `Student ID`,
        full_name = `Full Name`
    )
```

::: aside
If we have a lot to rename and that gets annoying, see `janitor::clean_names()`.
