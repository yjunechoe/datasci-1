## Why visualize? 

> “The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device.” — John Tukey

## Why visualize? 

> "`Visualization` is a fundamentally human activity. A good visualization will show you things you did not expect or raise new questions about the data. A good visualization might also hint that you’re asking the wrong question or that you need to collect different data. Visualizations can surprise you, but they don’t scale particularly well because they require a human to interpret them." -- R4DS

## ggplot2

![](/assests/images/ggplot-hexlogo.png){#fig-ggplothexlogo fig-align="center" width=20%}

## Using `ggplot2` 

Google Colab already has `ggplot2` installed by default. There is no need to run `install.packages()`. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: true
library(ggplot2)
```

## Why ggplot2? 

> "R has several systems for making graphs, but ggplot2 is one of the most elegant and most versatile. ggplot2 implements the `grammar of graphics`, a coherent system for describing and building graphs. With ggplot2, you can do more and faster by learning one system and applying it in many places." -- R4DS

## Today's data: `ratings` {.smaller}

> Subjective frequency ratings, ratings of estimated weight, and ratings of estimated size, averaged over subjects, for 81 concrete English nouns. -- languageR

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(languageR)
str(ratings)
```

## Today's data: `ratings` {.smaller}

We will make use of the following variables:

1. `Frequency` - actual word frequency
2. `meanFamiliarity` - subjective frequency rating
3. `Class` - whether word is a plant or animal

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: false
ratings %>% 
    select(Word, Frequency, meanFamiliarity, Class) %>%
    str()
```

## Today's goal {.smaller}

Create this figure showing the relationship between actual frequency and subjective frequency rating of each word, considering the class the word belongs to



```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency, 
        y = meanFamiliarity
    )
 ) +
  geom_point( 
    mapping = aes(color = Class), 
    size = 3
    ) +
  labs(
    title = "Subjective frequency ratings", 
    subtitle = "for 81 english nouns",
    x = "Actual frequency",
    y = "Frequency rating",
    color = "word class"
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 20) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")
```


# The basic ggplot

1. Using your `data`
2. define how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties (`aesthetics`)
3. determine the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data (`geom`)



## 1 `data` {.smaller}

> Use `ratings` data

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "1-3"
ggplot(
    data = ratings
 )
```

## 2 `aesthetic mapping` {.smaller}

> Map `Frequency` to x-axis and `meanFamiliarity` to y-axis. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "3-6"
ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency, 
        y = meanFamiliarity
    )
 )
```

## 3 `geom` {.smaller}

> Represent each value with a point.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "8"
ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency, 
        y = meanFamiliarity
    )
 ) +
  geom_point()
```

# Adding to the basics

## Mapping categorical variables {.smaller}

> When a categorical variable is mapped to an aesthetic, ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique value of the aesthetic (here color) ... a process known as `scaling`. -- R4DS

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency, 
        y = meanFamiliarity,
        color = Class
    )
 ) +
  geom_point()
```


## Global vs. local `aesthetics` {.smaller}

- **globally** in `ggplot()`, which are passed down to all geoms
- **locally** in `geom_*()` which are used by that geom only

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "9"
ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency, 
        y = meanFamiliarity
    )
 ) +
  geom_point( 
    mapping = aes(color = Class)
    ) 
```



## Mapping vs. setting `aesthetics` {.smaller}

- mapping allows us to determine a geom's aesthetics based on a variable, and is passed as argument in `aes()`
- setting allows us to set a geom's aestheics to a constant value (not based on any variable), and passed as argument in `geom_*()` directly

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "10"
ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency, 
        y = meanFamiliarity
    )
 ) +
  geom_point( 
    mapping = aes(color = Class), 
    size = 3
    ) 
```



# Labels


## `labels`: title and subtitle {.smaller}

> Add title "Subjective frequency ratings" with subtitle "for 81 english nouns"

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "12-15"
ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency, 
        y = meanFamiliarity
    )
 ) +
  geom_point( 
    mapping = aes(color = Class), 
    size = 3
    ) +
  labs(
    title = "Subjective frequency ratings", 
    subtitle = "for 81 english nouns"
  ) 
```

## `labels`: x and y axis {.smaller}

> Label x-axis "Actual frequency" and y-axis "Frequency rating"

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "15-16"
ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency, 
        y = meanFamiliarity
    )
 ) +
  geom_point( 
    mapping = aes(color = Class), 
    size = 3
    ) +
  labs(
    title = "Subjective frequency ratings", 
    subtitle = "for 81 english nouns",
    x = "Actual frequency",
    y = "Frequency rating"
  ) 
```

::: aside 
Note these are mapped to the aesthetic (x and y)
:::

## `labels`: legend {.smaller}

> Label the legend "word class".

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "17"
ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency, 
        y = meanFamiliarity
    )
 ) +
  geom_point( 
    mapping = aes(color = Class), 
    size = 3

  labs(
    title = "Subjective frequency ratings", 
    subtitle = "for 81 english nouns",
    x = "Actual frequency",
    y = "Frequency rating",
    color = "word class"
  ) 
```

::: aside 
Note these are mapped to the aesthetic as well (color)

# Theme and adjusting scaling

## `themes` {.smaller}

> Apply classic theme with base_size 20.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "19"
ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency, 
        y = meanFamiliarity
    )
 ) +
  geom_point( 
    mapping = aes(color = Class), 
    size = 3
    ) +
  labs(
    title = "Subjective frequency ratings", 
    subtitle = "for 81 english nouns",
    x = "Actual frequency",
    y = "Frequency rating",
    color = "word class"
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 20) 
```

## `scales`: changing color {.smaller}

> Remember: When a categorical variable is mapped to an aesthetic, ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique value of the aesthetic (here color) ... a process known as `scaling`. -- R4DS

# Geometric objects 

## `geom_*()` aka geoms {.smaller}

There are [many](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#geoms). We will start with these, and add a few additional geoms as we move through the course: 

| | |
| --- | ------- | 
| `geom_histogram()` | histogram, distribution of a continuous variable |
| `geom_density()` | distribution of a continuous variable |
| `geom_bar()` | distribution of a categorical data | 
| `geom_point()` |  scatterplot |
| `geom_smooth()` | smoothed line of best fit |

## `geom_histogram()` 

> A histogram divides the x-axis into equally spaced bins and then uses the height of a bar to display the number of observations that fall in each bin. -- R4DS

    )
) + 
    geom_histogram(

ggplot(
    data = ratings,

## `geom_point()` with `geom_smooth(method="lm")` {.smaller}

We can also map to color, by specifying globally

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency, 
        y = meanFamiliarity,
        color = Class
    )
 ) +
  geom_point( 
    size = 3
    ) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Subjective frequency ratings", 
    subtitle = "for 81 english nouns",
    x = "Actual frequency",
    y = "Frequency rating",
    color = "word class"
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 20) 
```

## `geom_point()` with `geom_smooth(method="lm")` {.smaller}

Or include only a single smooth, by specifying color in the point geom only

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column

ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(

    size = 3
    ) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Subjective frequency ratings", 
    subtitle = "for 81 english nouns",
    x = "Actual frequency",
    y = "Frequency rating",
    color = "word class"
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 20) 
```

# Shortcuts 

## ggplot2 calls {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

Explicit argument names:

```{r}
ggplot(
    data = ratings,
    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency,
        y = meanFamiliarity
    )
) + 
   geom_point()
```


::: 


::: {.column width=50%}

Implied argument names:

```{r}
ggplot(
    ratings,
    aes(
        x = Frequency,
        y = meanFamiliarity
    )
) + 
   geom_point()

## the pipe `%>%` {.smaller}

> the pipe takes the thing on its left and passes it along to the function on its right 

. . .

`x %>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`

. . . 

```{r}
x <- c(1.0, 2.245, 3, 4.22222)
x

# pass x as an argument to function usual way
round(x, digits = 2)
```

. . . 
```{r}
# pass x as an argument to function with pipe
x %>% round(digits = 2)
```


::: aside
There are two ways to write the pipe: `%>%` or `|>`

## the pipe `%>%` and ggplot {.smaller}

    mapping = aes(
        x = Frequency,
        y = meanFamiliarity
    )

Note that we pipe `%>%` in arguments to functions but we ADD `+` layers to ggplot. Common mistake!
