## $R^2$ overestimates model accuracy

One thing we can ask is how well the model describes our specific sample of data. But the question we actually want to answer is *how well does the model we fit describe the population we are interested in*. 

- The problem is that we usually only have access to the sample we've collected and $R^2$ tends to **overestimate** the accuracy of the model on the population. In other words, the $R^2$ of the model we fit on our sample will be larger than the $R^2$ of the model fit to the population. 
- Further, the population is (usually) unknown to us. To quantify the **true accuracy** of a fitted model -- that is, how well the model describes the population, not the sample we collected -- we can use a technique called **cross-validation**.

- Accuracy of the fitted model on the sample `overestimates true accuracy` of fitted model.




## Overfitting {.smaller}

You have the freedom to fit your sample data better and better (you can add more and more terms, increasing the $R^2$ value). But be careful not to fit the sample data *too* well. 

- any given set of data contains not only the `true model` (`signal`), but also random variation (`noise`). 
- Fitting the sample data too well means we fit not only the signal but also the noise in the data. 
- An overfit model will perform really well on the data it has been trained on (the sample), but would predict new, unseen values poorly. 
- Our goal is to find the `optimal fitted model` -- the one that gets as close to the true model as possible without overfitting. 

## Overfitting exercise 

- Let's use the swim records data to demonstrate that $R^2$ increases as we add more parameters. 

## Cross-validation justificaiton {.smaller}

- We want to know: *how well does the model we fit describe the population we are interested in*. 
- But we only have the sample, and $R^2$ on the sample will tend to overestimate the model's accuracy on the population.
- To estimate the accuracy of the model on the population, we can use `cross-validation`

## Cross-validation steps {.smaller}

Given a sample of data, there are 3 simple steps to any cross-validation technique:

1. Leave some data out
2. Fit a model (to the data kept in)
3. Evaluate the model on the left out data (e.g. $R^2$)

. . . 

There are many ways to do cross-validation — reflecting that there are many ways we can leave some data out — but they all follow this general 3-step process.

## Two common cross-validation approaches {.smaller}

- In `leave-one-out cross-validation`, we leave out a single data point and use the fitted model to predict that single point. We repeat this process for every data point, then evaluate each model's prediction on the left out points (we can use $R^2$!). 
- In `k-fold cross-validation`, instead of leaving out a single data point, we randomly divide the dataset into $k$ parts and use the fitted model to predict that *part*. We repeat this process for every part, then evaluate each model's prediction on the left out parts (again, we can use $R^2$!).
