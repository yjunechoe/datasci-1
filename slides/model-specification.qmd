# Review 

Sampling distribution and hypothesis testing with Correlation!

## Exploring relationships {.smaller}

To review what we learned before break, let's explore the relationship between Frequency and meanFamiliarity in the `ratings` dataset of the `languageR` package. 

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: false 
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5

ratings %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Frequency, y = meanFamiliarity))  +
    geom_point()
```

## Is there a relationship?  {.smaller}

If there was no relationship, we'd say there are **independent**: knowing the value of one provides no information about about the other. But that's not the case here.

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: false 
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5

ratings %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Frequency, y = meanFamiliarity))  +
    geom_point()
```

## Yes, a linear relationship {.smaller}

In a linear relationship, when one variable goes up the other goes up (positive); or when one goes up the other goes down (negative). 

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: false 
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5

ratings %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Frequency, y = meanFamiliarity))  +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(color = "blue", method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

## Quantify with correlation {.smaller}

One way to quantify linear relationships is with **correlation** ($r$). Correlation expresses the linear relationship as a range from -1 (perfectly negative) to 1 (perfectly positive). 

![](/assests/images/correlation.jpeg)

## Computing correlation in R {.smaller}

We can compute a correlation with R's built in `cor(x,y)` function

. . . 

```{r}
#| output-location: column

cor(
  x = ratings$Frequency, 
  y = ratings$meanFamiliarity
)
```

. . . 

Or via the `infer` pacakge. 

. . . 

```{r}
#| output-location: column

(obs_corr <- ratings %>%
  specify(
    response = meanFamiliarity, 
    explanatory = Frequency
  ) %>%
  calculate(stat = "correlation"))
```

## Correlation uncertainty {.smaller}

Just like the mean — and all other test statistics! — $r$ is subject to sampling variability. We can indicate our uncertainty around the correlation the same way we always have:

. . . 

Construct the sampling distribution for the correlation: 

. . . 
```{r}
#| output-location: column

sampling_distribution <- ratings %>%
  specify(
    response = meanFamiliarity, 
    explanatory = Frequency
  ) %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "correlation")

head(sampling_distribution)
```

. . . 

Compute a confidence interval 

. . . 

```{r}
#| output-location: column

ci <- sampling_distribution %>% 
  get_ci(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

ci
```

## 💪 In-class Exercise 7.1 {.smaller}

*Take a few minutes to try this yourself!*

Use the `infer` way to visualize the sampling distribution and shade the confidence interval we just computed. Change the x-axis label to **stat (correlation)** as pictured below. 

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5

sampling_distribution %>%
  visualize() + 
  shade_ci(ci) +
  labs(x = "stat (correlation)")
```

## Hypothesis testing our correlation {.smaller}

How do we test whether the correlation we observed is significantly different from zero? Hypothesis test! 

. . . 

Step 1: Construct the null distribution, the sampling distribution of the null hypothesis

. . . 

```{r}
#| output-location: column

null_distribution_corr <- ratings %>% 
  specify(
    response = meanFamiliarity, 
    explanatory = Frequency
  ) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "correlation") 

null_distribution_corr %>% head
```

. . . 

Step 2: How likley is our observed value under the null? Get a p-value.

. . . 

```{r}
#| output-location: column

p <- null_distribution_corr %>%
  get_p_value(
    obs_stat = obs_corr, 
    direction = "both")
p
```


## Hypothesis testing our correlation {.smaller}

How do we test whether the correlation we observed is significantly different from zero? Hypothesis test! 

. . . 

Step 3: Decide whether to reject the null! 

. . . 

```{r}
#| output-location: column

null_distribution_corr %>% 
  visualize() + 
  shade_p_value(
    obs_stat = obs_corr, 
    direction = "two-sided"
  ) 
```

. . . 

Interpret our p-value. Should we reject the null hypothesis?

# Model building 

Big picture overview of the model building process and the types of models we might encounter in our research. 

## Correlation is model building {.smaller}

Correlation is a simple case of model building, in which we use one value ($x$) to predict another ($y$). 

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: false 
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5

ggplot(ratings, aes(x = Frequency, y = meanFamiliarity)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 1) +
    annotate(x = 2.2, y = 6, geom = "text", label = "● Data", size = 6) + 
    labs(x = "Frequency \n x", y = "y \n meanFamiliarity") +
    annotate(x = 7.5, y = 2.3, geom = "text", label = expression(r == 0.482), size = 6, color = "red")
    

```


## Correlation is model building {.smaller}

Even more specifically — formally, the **model specification** — we are fitting the linear model $y = ax+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are free parameters.

```{r}
#| echo: false 
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5

ggplot(ratings, aes(x = Frequency, y = meanFamiliarity)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 1) +
    geom_smooth(color = "blue", method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    annotate(x = 2.2, y = 6, geom = "text", label = "● Data", size = 6) + 
    labs(x = "Frequency \n x", y = "y \n meanFamiliarity") + 
    annotate(x = 2.2, y = 5.5, geom = "text", label = "--- Model", size = 6, color = "blue") + 
    annotate(x = 7.5, y = 2.3, geom = "text", label = expression(r == 0.482), size = 6, color = "red") 

```

::: 
::: {.column width=50%}

- Model specification: $y = ax + b$ 
- Estimate free parameters: $a$ and $b$
- Fitted model: $y = 0.39x + 2.02$

:::
::::

## How do we get $r = 0.48$ ? {.smaller}

The link between correlation and linear models is understood when we normalize our variables with a z-score. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column

z_ratings <- ratings %>%
  select(Frequency, meanFamiliarity) %>%
  mutate(
    z_Freq = scale(Frequency), 
    z_meanFamil = scale(meanFamiliarity)
  )

z_ratings %>% head

```

- A z-score gets the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean.

## Correlation is the slope of the model {.smaller}

Correlation is the slope of the line that best predicts $y$ from $x$ (after z-scoring)
```{r}
#| echo: false 
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-height: 10

ggplot(ratings, aes(x = Frequency, y = meanFamiliarity)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 1) +
    geom_smooth(color = "blue", method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    annotate(x = 7.5, y = 2.3, geom = "text", label = expression(r == 0.482), size = 10, color = "red") + 
    annotate(x = 7.0, y = 2.0, geom = "text", label = expression(y == 0.39*x + 2.02), size = 10, color = "blue") +
    labs(title = "raw data") +
    theme_classic(base_size = 30)

ggplot(z_ratings, aes(x = z_Freq, y = z_meanFamil)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 1) +
    geom_smooth(color = "red", method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    annotate(x = 2, y = -1.5, geom = "text", label = expression(r == 0.482), size = 10, color = "red") +
    annotate(x = 1.75, y = -1.8, geom = "text", label = expression(y == 0.482*x + 0), size = 10, color = "blue") +
    labs(title = "z scored data") +
    theme_classic(base_size = 30)

```




## Model building overview 

- `Model specification` (this week): specify the functional form of the model.
- `Model fitting`: you have the form, how do you estimate the free parameters? 
- `Model accuracy`: you've estimated the parameters, how well does that model describe your data? 
- `Model reliability`: when you estimate the parameters, you want to quantify your uncertainty on your estimates

## Model specification {.smaller}

Recall that `model specification` is one aspect of the model building process in which we select the form of the model (the type of model)

1. **Response variable ($y$):** Specify the variable you want to predict/explain (output). 
2. **Explanatory variables($x_i$):** Specify the variables that may explain the variation in the response (inputs). 
3. **Functional form:** Specify the relationship between the response and explanatory variables. *For linear models, we use the linear model equation!*
4. **Model terms:** Specify *how* to include your explanatory variables in the model (since they can be included in more than one way).

## Model specification {.smaller}

The following issues can also be considered part of the model specification process.

- **Model assumptions:** Check any assumptions underlying the model you selected (e.g. does the model assume the relationship is linear?).
- **Model complexity:** Simple models are easier to interpret but may not capture all complexities in the data. Complex models may suffer from overfitting the data or being difficult to interpret.

. . . 

*A well-specified model should be based on a clear understanding of the data, the underlying relationships, and the research question.*

## Specifying the functional form 

- Literally specifying the mathematical formula we're going to use to represent the relationship between our response and explanatory variables.
- We already know it: **linear models** are models in whch the response variable ($y$) is a weighted sum of the explanatory variables ($x_i$)
- $y=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_ix_i$ 

## 🥸 Aliases of $y=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_ix_i$ 

The **linear model equation** can be expressed in many ways, but *they are all this same thing*

1. in **high school algebra**: $y=ax+b$. 
2. in **machine learning**: $y = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n$ 
3. in **statistics**: $y = β_0 + β_1x_1 + β_2x_2 + ... + β_nx_n + ε$
4. in **matrix** notation: $y = Xβ + ε$

## Specify our first model 

To illustrate how this simple equation scales up to complex models, let's start with a simple case ("toy", "tractable"). 

```{r}
#| echo: false 
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-height: 10

toy <- tibble(
  x = c(1, 2), 
  y = c(3, 5))
toy

toy %>%
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size=6) +
  theme_bw(base_size=45)+
  ylim(c(0,6)) +
  xlim(c(0,3))
```

## 💪 In class exercise 7.4

Specify our model! 

```{dot}
//|echo: false

digraph G {

rankdir=LR;  // Left to Right layout

  // Column 1: x values
  x1 [label="x1"];
  x2 [label="x2"];
  x3 [label="x3"];

  // Column 2: model
  model [label="Linear model", shape=box, width=1.5, height=1, style = filled];

  // Column 3: y value
  y [label="y"];

  // Keep x values in the same rank
  { rank=same; x1; x2; x3; }

  // Keep alignment using invisible edges
  x1 -> model;
  x2 -> model;
  x3 -> model;
  x4 -> model;
  x5 -> model;

  model -> y;  // Connect the model to y
}

```

## System of equations 

In our simple dataset, we can appreciate that we have a system of equations. We have **two unknowns** (free parameters) and **two datapoints**

- so we have 2 equations, 2 unknowns. 
  - `c(1, 3) ->` $w_11 + w_21 = 3$
  - `c(2, 5) ->` $w_11 + w_22 = 5$

- which have a solution: 
  - $w_1 = 1$ and $w_2 = 2$

##  🪄 Fit our model to our data {.smaller}

We'll learn what is going on under the hood of model fitting next week, but for now, we can appreciate that we are solving a system of equations:

. . . 

with `lm()`:

```{r}
#| output-location: column
lm(y ~ x, data = toy)
```

. . . 

with `infer`: 

```{r}
#| output-location: column
toy %>%
  specify(response = y, explanatory = x) %>%
  fit()
```

## Many equations, many unknowns 

When we have multiple data points, we are essentially solving for the best line (or hyperplane, in higher dimensions) that fits the data. 

- For each data point, we create an equation based on the linear model
- Which leads to a system of equations. 
- With 2 unknowns and 2 data points, we have 2 equations. 


## Enter the matrix $y = Xβ + ε$

When we have **more equations than unknowns** we cannot solve the system directly (we have an **overdetermined system**), but we can find a soulution with linear algebra.

```{r}
library(mosaic)
glimpse(SwimRecords)
```

## 💪 In class exercise 7.6

Plot the swim records data, then use your model specification worksheet to specify the model. 

## Response variable $y$ {.smaller}

What is the thing you are trying to understand?

```{r}
#| echo: false
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 26))
SwimRecords %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = time, x = year)) +
    geom_point() 

```

## Explanatory variable(s) $x_i$ {.smaller} 

What could **explain** the variation in your response variable? 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## year 

```{r}
#| echo: false

SwimRecords %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = time, x = year)) +
    geom_point() 

```

## year + sex

```{r}
#| echo: false

SwimRecords %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = time, x = year, shape= sex)) +
    geom_point() 

```

## Functional form

- Linear model
- $y=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_ix_i$ 


## Model terms {.smaller}

Model terms describe *how* to include our explanatory variables in our model formula — there is more than one way!

1. Intercept
2. Main 
3. Interaction 
4. Transformation

## Intercept  {.smaller}

  - in R: `y ~ 1`, in eq: $y=w_1x_1$

```{r}
#| echo: false

model <- lm(time ~ 1, data = SwimRecords)
model_data <- SwimRecords %>%
    mutate(model_value = predict(model, SwimRecords))

SwimRecords %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = time, x = year)) +
    geom_point(aes(shape = sex), size = 2) +
    geom_point(
        size = 3,
        color = "blue",
        data = model_data, 
        aes(y = model_value, x = year)) 

```

## Main {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}

## year

- in R: `y ~ 1 + year`, in eq: $y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2$

```{r}
#| echo: false

model <- lm(time ~ 1 + year, data = SwimRecords)
model_data <- SwimRecords %>%
    mutate(model_value = predict(model, SwimRecords))

SwimRecords %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = time, x = year)) +
    geom_point(aes(shape = sex), size = 2) +
    geom_point(
        size = 3,
        color = "blue",
        data = model_data, 
        aes(y = model_value, x = year)) 

```

## sex 

- in R: `y ~ 1 + sex`, in eq: $y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2$


```{r}
#| echo: false

model <- lm(time ~ sex, data = SwimRecords)
model_data <- SwimRecords %>%
    mutate(model_value = predict(model, SwimRecords))

SwimRecords %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = time, x = year, shape = sex)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    geom_point(
        size = 3,
        color = "blue",
        data = model_data, 
        aes(y = model_value, x = year)) 

```

## year + sex

- in R: `y ~ 1 + year`, in eq: $y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3$


```{r}
#| echo: false

model <- lm(time ~ year + sex, data = SwimRecords)
model_data <- SwimRecords %>%
    mutate(model_value = predict(model, SwimRecords))

SwimRecords %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = time, x = year, shape = sex)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    geom_point(
       size = 3,
        color = "blue",
        data = model_data, 
        aes(y = model_value, x = year)) 

```

::: 

## Interaction {.smaller}

- in R: `y ~ 1 + year + gender + year:gender` 
    - or the short way: `y ~ 1 + year * gender`
- in eq: $y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + w_4x_4$ where $x_4$ is $x_2x_3$


```{r}
#| echo: false

model <- lm(time ~ year*sex, data = SwimRecords)
model_data <- SwimRecords %>%
    mutate(model_value = predict(model, SwimRecords))

SwimRecords %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = time, x = year, shape = sex)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    geom_point(
       size = 3,
        color = "blue",
        data = model_data, 
        aes(y = model_value, x = year)) 

```

## Transformation {.smaller}

- in R: `y ~ 1 + year * sex + I(year^2)` 
- in eq: $y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + w_4x_4$ + $w_5x_5$ 
  - where $x_4$ is $x_2x_3$ and $x_5$ is $x_2^2$

```{r}
#| echo: false

model <- lm(time ~ year * sex + I(year^2), data = SwimRecords)
model_data <- SwimRecords %>%
    mutate(model_value = predict(model, SwimRecords))

SwimRecords %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = time, x = year, shape = sex)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    geom_point(
       size = 3,
        color = "blue",
        data = model_data, 
        aes(y = model_value, x = year))
